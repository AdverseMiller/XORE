# XORE
Xore (XOR-Encrypt) is a program that uses a combination of XOR bitwise and ASCII shift to get Pretty Good Encryption with files.

Xore will encrypt/decrypt any file (UTF-8 or not) with a generic string password. 

This program can be compiled with g++ and the flags/arguments for it can be found with -h.

I'm going to be keep improving this program as right now it's pretty basic. 
I will likely add the ability to eventually encrypt entire folders/directory as right now you can only do 1.
